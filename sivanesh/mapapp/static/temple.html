    A temple is a building or sacred place used for worship, prayer, and spiritual rituals in many religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and certain branches of Judaism. While Christians typically refer to their houses of worship as churches, temples serve a similar function in other faiths, providing a spiritual center for communities to practice their beliefs.
