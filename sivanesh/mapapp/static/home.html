    Seekkusunai village is known for the French colonial-era villas lining its leafy streets. Eateries from quirky cafes to upscale courtyard restaurants serve French, Indian, and Franco-Tamil cuisine, while small crafts shops dot cobbled lanes. The beachfront promenade is popular for evening strolls. Religious sites include the Sri Aurobindo Ashram meditation center and the ornate Arulmigu Manakula
